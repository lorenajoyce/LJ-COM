Autumn nights, I confine
Myself in galleries of us just because I miss you
You don't have to remind me of the pains of circumstance
That demand our distance

I'll be right here in case you need to talk
I'm just a call away from you

Why can't we be together, baby
Why does it take so long
Why can't we be together, baby
Should we keep holding on

Even when hope seems gone

Autumn leaves fall on me
They rustle as I walk alone
I wish I was with you

I'd take a chance, hold your hand
You'd say no cause you've always been just a bit low-key

Oh pardon me for daydreaming
It's all that I have left for now

Why can't we be together, baby
Why does it take so long
Why can't we be together, baby
Should we keep holding on

Even when hope seems gone

Must we always be in different seasons?
I don't wanna lose this
I hunger for your kiss

Can I get a piece of your affection
In all of the madness baby
I just wanna be with you
I just wanna be with you

Autumn nights
Why does it take so long?
Autumn nights
Should we keep holding on?

Why can't we be together, baby
Why does it take so long
Why can't we be together, baby
Should we keep holding on
Even when hope seems gone?
